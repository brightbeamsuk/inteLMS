Goal
When a learner clicks Save & resume later, their course status becomes IN PROGRESS, their exact place is stored, a Resume button appears, and pressing Resume returns them to the saved point (not the start). Admin view must also show IN PROGRESS with current % complete.

What to implement

Start attempt (server)

When the course is opened, create or reuse an IN PROGRESS attempt for the current user and course.

Return: attemptId, status=IN_PROGRESS.

Save progress (server)

When Save & resume later is clicked, store:

lastLocation (from SCORM cmi.location),

suspendData (from SCORM cmi.suspend_data),

progressPct (a number 0–100),

set/keep status=IN_PROGRESS.

Return: confirmation with the same values.

Latest attempt (server)

Provide a simple “get latest” action that returns the most recent attempt for this user and course, including lastLocation, suspendData, progressPct, and status.

Complete (server)

On course finish, set status=COMPLETED, store score and passed.

Client behaviour

On course open: call the start attempt action and keep attemptId in memory and localStorage.

Save & resume later button:

Read cmi.location and cmi.suspend_data.

Send them with attemptId to save progress.

On success: immediately update the learner dashboard tile to show IN PROGRESS and reveal the Resume button (no page refresh).

Resume button:

Call latest attempt.

If status=IN_PROGRESS and a lastLocation/suspendData exist, apply them to the SCORM runtime before launching the content, and then launch directly at that saved point.

Admin updates

Whenever save succeeds, update the admin view for that user/course to IN PROGRESS with the returned progressPct.

Local fallback (must have)

Also store attemptId, lastLocation, and suspendData in localStorage after a save. If the server cannot be reached later, Resume should still jump to the saved point using the local cache. When the server works again, prefer server data.

Acceptance test (must pass)

Start a course → go to slide 4.

Click Save & resume later → learner dashboard shows IN PROGRESS and a Resume button.

Click Resume → course opens at slide 4 (not slide 1).

Admin view shows IN PROGRESS with the correct % complete.

Important reliability rules

Do not silently swallow errors. If saving fails, show a banner: “Couldn’t save to server — saved locally, you can still resume.”

Never overwrite a newer server record with older local data. Prefer the latest timestamp.

Keep the protocol and paths exactly as they are now; just make them perform the actions above reliably.
