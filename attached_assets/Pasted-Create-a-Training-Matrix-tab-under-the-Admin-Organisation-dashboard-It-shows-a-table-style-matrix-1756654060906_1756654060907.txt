Create a Training Matrix tab under the Admin (Organisation) dashboard. It shows a table-style matrix with:

Columns: Each course name (from the platform library that this organisation has assigned).

Rows: Each staff member in this organisation.

Cells: Status for that staff member on that course, derived from their most recent attempt and expiry date.

Cell rules (with colour coding and text labels)

Red (Out of date): Course completed but past expiry date as of today.

Amber (Expiring): Completed and expiring within the next 30 days (today + 30).

Green (In date): Completed and not expiring within 30 days.

Light grey (Not yet completed): Assigned but no valid completion recorded.

If a course does not expire, and is completed, show Green with “No expiry”.

Each cell shows the status label and a small date (e.g., “Exp: 14 Oct 2025” or “No expiry”).

Clicking a cell opens a simple detail panel with: course title, user name, last score, completion date, expiry date, attempt history link, and an Assign/Remind button.

Filters and saved views (org-scoped)

Provide filters for: Team/Department, Role, Course(s), Status (Red/Amber/Green/Grey), Due/Expiry window (e.g., next 7/30/60/90 days), and Show mandatory only.

Add a “Save this filter as a view” button.

Saved views are visible only within this organisation.

Saved views should persist for this Admin until they choose Clear or select a different view.

Allow naming the view (e.g., “Room Leaders – Expiring 30 days”).

Include a Default view button to return to the unfiltered matrix.

Sorting, legend, and quick totals

Allow sorting by most overdue first (Red → Amber → Grey → Green), by staff name, or by soonest expiry.

Add a legend above the table with coloured chips and labels for Red/Amber/Green/Grey.

Show quick totals above the matrix for the current filter: Red count, Amber count, Green count, Not completed.

Reminders and exports

Add “Send reminders” for selected rows or for the current filtered set (sends to learners and CC’s Admin if enabled).

Add Export CSV and Print/PDF for the current filtered view.

Layout and usability

Use DaisyUI components only.

Sticky header for course columns and sticky first column for staff names.

Horizontal scroll for many courses, with a compact but readable cell design.

Tooltips on hover summarising: completion date, expiry date, last score, attempts.

Mobile: stack the matrix as a staff-by-course list with the same colours and labels.

Data source and timing

Pull live data from the platform’s central records for: assignments, completions, and any course expiry period.

Time zone: Use Europe/London for “today” when calculating out-of-date and expiring-in-30-days.

Recalculate colours any time data changes (new completion, updated expiry, new assignment).

Edge cases

If a user is not assigned a course, show a blank cell with a faint dash.

If a course is retired for this organisation, keep historical completions but grey out the column heading with “Retired”.

If a course has a custom expiry window set by the Admin for this org, use that; otherwise use the course default.

Acceptance checks (must pass)

Assign a course with a 12-month expiry; mark one completion 13 months ago → cell shows Red with correct expiry date.

Completion in 20 days to expire → shows Amber.

Completion with no expiry → shows Green and “No expiry”.

Uncompleted assignment → Light grey.

Save a filter as “Room Leaders – 30 days” → persists for this Admin; switching tabs and returning keeps it applied until Clear.

Export CSV reflects the current filter.

“Send reminders” targets only the currently filtered staff/courses in this organisation.

Refreshing the page retains the saved view and the matrix renders quickly.
